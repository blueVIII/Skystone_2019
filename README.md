## NOTICE

This repository contains the public FTC SDK for the SKYSTONE (2019-2020) competition season.  This repo contains Team Code and belongs to <B>BlueVIII 15343</B>

Formerly this software project was hosted [here](https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app).  Teams who are competing in the SKYSTONE Challenge should use this [new SKYSTONE repository](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SKYSTONE) instead of the older (and no longer updated) ftc_app repository.

## Welcome!
This GitHub repository contains the source code that is used to build an Android app to control a *FIRST* Tech Challenge competition robot.  To use this SDK, download/clone the entire project to your local computer.

## Getting Started
If you are new to robotics or new to the *FIRST* Tech Challenge, then you should consider reviewing the [FTC Blocks Tutorial](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SKYSTONE/wiki/Blocks-Tutorial) to get familiar with how to use the control system:  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[FTC Blocks Online Tutorial](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SKYSTONE/wiki/Blocks-Tutorial)

Even if you are an advanced Java programmer, it is helpful to start with the [FTC Blocks tutorial](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SKYSTONE/wiki/Blocks-Tutorial), and then migrate to the [OnBot Java Tool](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SKYSTONE/wiki/OnBot-Java-Tutorial) or to [Android Studio](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SKYSTONE/wiki/Android-Studio-Tutorial) afterwards.

## Downloading the Project
If you are an Android Studio programmer, there are several ways to download this repo.  Note that if you use the Blocks or OnBot Java Tool to program your robot, then you do not need to download this repository.

* If you are a git user, you can clone the most current version of the repository:

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;git clone https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SKYSTONE.git</p>

* Or, if you prefer, you can use the "Download Zip" button available through the main repository page.  Downloading the project as a .ZIP file will keep the size of the download manageable.

* You can also download the project folder (as a .zip or .tar.gz archive file) from the Downloads subsection of the [Releases](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SKYSTONE/releases) page for this repository.

Once you have downloaded and uncompressed (if needed) your folder, you can use Android Studio to import the folder  ("Import project (Eclipse ADT, Gradle, etc.)").

## Getting Help
